MyPGP provides a graphical user interface for pgp encryption and signing. It is fully compatible with OpenPGP, and GnuPG.

It relies on BouncyCastle libraries for the cryptographic primitives.

It uses file system folders to store keys, either single or key rings, organized as a nested tree of folders.

It can also create lists of keys for bulk operations.
